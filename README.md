## About This Project:

This was a homework assignment as part of the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp. The daily planner allows a user to enter their "todos" for the standard work day, from 9-5, and stores the information, even if the user refreshes the page.

This website was built with jQuery, HTML and CSS.

## Summary of Project:

The website is a daily planner, from 9AM-5PM, that displays the date and current time, and allows the user to input daily tasks, click submit, and save those tasks in the planner. The hours are also color coded by past (gray), present (red) and future (green) hours.
